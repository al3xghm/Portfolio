In addition to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the site's structure and interactivity, I've also employed PHP and MySQL to manage the database and server-side functionalities.

The site is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which separates the application's logic, data, and presentation layers. This structure makes the code more organized and maintainable, enabling me to add new features and functionalities easily. With the mini-blog, users can share their thoughts and ideas with others in a user-friendly and intuitive interface.",
